Implemented in Assembly language, Three Men's Morris is an abstract strategy game played on a three by three board, akin to tic-tac-toe. 
Players aim to align three of their pieces in a row, forming a "mill" to win the game. The board starts empty, with players taking turns
to place their pieces on intersections. Once all pieces are placed, players then move one piece per turn to any vacant point on the board. 
There are variations on movement rules, but the objective remains the same: achieve a winning alignment before your opponent.
